policies, its leverage—the ratio of debt to capital —would soon be very low again.", "14": "Though the board did not know it yet, Dahlgren was considering a radical proposal: a substantial increase  in  the  firm’s  leverage,  implemented  with  a  Euro-denominated  bond  issue,  and  combined with an aggressive program of share repurchases.", "15": "This would be a sea change from the firm’s

of the wealthiest men in the world when he killed  himself  in  March  1932.", "21": "Kreuger  had  become  wealthy  by  building  Swedish  Match  into  an international business empire comprised of national monopolies in safety matches.", "22": "At the time of his death, Swedish Match had a globally dominant position, selling 66% of the world’s matches.", "23": "1 1", "24": "After  graduating  from  the  Royal  Institute  of  Technology  in  Stockholm  with  a  degree  in mechanical engineering, Kreuger had traveled the world between 1900 and 1907 working in various jobs in Mexico, South

(J&V), controlling 80% of the  Swedish match market and threatening the Kreuger family company.", "39": "Using contacts in the banking industry and his construction profits, Ivar Kreuger was able to raise debt to finance  an  expansion  of  the  family’s  company.", "40": "He  used  bank  loans  to  merge  Sweden’s  nine remaining  match  companies  in 1913  into AB  Förenade  Svenska  Tändsticksfabriks  (Förenade), with Kreuger in control.", "41": "During  World  War  I,  J&V  sold  matches  to  both  sides  of  the  conflict.", "42": "When  the  Allies  (initially Britain, France,

"To continue expanding, Kreuger  needed  funding  beyond  the  capacity  of  Swedish  banks.", "48": "In  1923,  Kreuger  set  up  the International Match  Company (IMCO)  in New  York  City as  a  way to  raise money  from American investors.", "49": "Raising equity abroad threatened to put Kreuger in violation of Swedish laws that forbade foreign  majority  ownership  of  Swedish  companies.",

stock in Kreuger’s companies without violating Swedish law.", "51": "Dual share classes  of  this  type  are  still  in  common  use  around  the  world.", "52": "Kreuger  also  pioneered  the  use

monopolies that sustained these payouts.", "60": "Kreuger became world famous.", "61": "The stock market crash in 1929 and the worsening business cycle made things harder for Kreuger.", "62":

 money  ran  out,  Kreuger paid dividends to his earlier investors with money received from new investors.", "65": "He covered this up with fraudulent accounting practices and counterfeit documents.",

restrictions.", "94": "However,  some analysts argued that snus faced lower regulatory risks than cigarettes because the health risks were different.", "95": "5 5", "96": "In  Sweden  and  Norway,

common  than smoking cigarettes.", "100": "7 7 Growth was also stimulated by the fact that the EU decided to remove the cancer warning  from  the  snus  can  in  2002.", "101": "With  attractive  margins  and  strong  growth  prospects,  several competitors surfaced during this time on the Swedish market.", "102": "The United States was the biggest growth market for smokeless tobacco products,

cigarettes.", "106": "9 9 Red Man, Swedish Match’s chewing tobacco brand, was sold only in the United States and was the market leader, with a 43% market share in 2004, and Swedish Match was hoping for further growth of snus products.", "107": "10 10", "108": "After  smokeless  tobacco,  Swedish  Match’s  most  important  single  product  was  cigars,  which comprised  24%  of  sales  and  59%

chewing  tobacco,  and  cigars,  Swedish  Match  also  produced  pipe tobacco,  although  this  was  a  declining  market  (it  shrunk  14%  in  U.S.  sales  volume  in  2004,  for example).", "118": "Pipe tobacco accounted for about 9% of the company’s operating income.", "119": "Swedish Match maintained  a  16%  market  share  in  the  U.S.  and  profitability  for  pipe  tobacco  remained

each represented approximately one-third of company sales.", "122": "Costs matched revenues fairly well, so the net currency exposure of Swedish Match was low.", "123": "Swedish Match had a conservative policy in all financial matters.", "124": "At the time of the firm’s IPO in 1996,  management  had  decided  to  target  book  equity  of  at  least  30%  of  assets  (corresponding  to interest-bearing  debt  over  assets  of  20%–40%,  depending  on  the  amount  of  non-interest-bearing liabilities).", "125": "The firm paid high dividends and made some share repurchases.", "126": "For a period, leverage had  increased  due  to  acquisitions  in  the  cigar  area.", "127": "The  company  had  an  international  short-term bond program (the “Global Medium Term Note Program”) and a small Swedish bond program, both started in the late 1990s and by then largely paid off.", "128": "The firm had a credit rating of A- from rating agency S&P (see Exhibit 5 for data on ratings).", "129": "A New Financial Policy", "130": "Swedish  Match’s  financial  policy  was  set  by  the  board  of  directors  (see  Exhibit  6  for  a  list  of members).", "131": "In accordance with Swedish law, two labor representatives were voting members on the board.", "132": "Swedish Match’s president and CEO, Sven Hindrikes, appointed in 2004, was also a member of the board.", "133": "Hindrikes had asked Dahlgren to propose a detailed financial policy first to the board’s audit committee and then to the full board in its October 25 meeting.", "134": "The board would decide on a financial policy, including how to measure leverage and what targets to apply.", "135": "Several factors played into Dahlgren’s sense that this was a good time to reconsider the company’s financial policies.", "136": "First, Sweden had recently instituted a new corporation law that allowed firms to repurchase shares even if it resulted in negative consolidated book equity for the group.", "137": "Second, a continuation of the current policy would reduce leverage in the next few years.", "138": "In Dahlgren’s view, Swedish  Match  faced  several  potential  benefits  of  taking  on  more  debt.", "139": "Leverage  reduced  the corporate income tax bill.", "140": "As in the United States and many other countries, interest expenses were deductible from corporate income  under Swedish tax law.", "141": "The corporate income tax rate was 28%, where  it  was  expected  to  remain.", "142": "c c There  were  other  advantages  to  higher  leverage.", "143": "Some  viewed excess cash or debt capacity negatively, seeing them as potentially leading to waste and inefficiency.", "144": "Further,  the act  of  issuing  new debt  might  be  seen as  a  sign  of  strength.", "145": "Institutional  investors seemed to agree with a more aggressive policy.", "146": "In a survey of some large owners earlier that year, several had expressed support for increased repurchases.", "147": "A Citibank analyst reported, “we expect the company to buy back SEK 9–12 billion in shares by the end of 2007.” 15 15 Dahlgren also felt that the lack of  explicit  financial  targets  created  unnecessary  uncertainty.", "148": "Finally,  looking  to  international  peers (see Exhibit 7 for selected financials), Dahlgren noticed that many of them maintained high leverage.", "149": "In contrast, Dahlgren also ticked off the disadvantages of debt in his head.", "150": "Net income would be lower, because some of the firm’s cash flows would go to interest payments.", "151": "Raising new debt might", "155": "A New Financial Policy at Swedish Match  212-017", "157": "also expose the firm to bond market conditions when needing to refinance.", "158": "Additionally, taking on more debt would reduce financial flexibility going forward.", "159": "Dahlgren also had to consider the risk to the  firm’s  business.", "160": "If  the  smokeless  tobacco  products  faced  more  competition,  the  ability  to  pay interest payments or principal could be in doubt.", "161": "A forced sale of assets, or even bankruptcy, was a possibility.", "162": "Credit rating agencies would lower Swedish Match’s credit rating accordingly.", "163": "Dahlgren and finance vice president Joakim Tilly discussed a bond issue in the European market, given the modest size of the Swedish bond market.", "164": "Based on conversations with bankers in London, they felt that bond issues below €300 million, or approximately SEK 3 billion, would be impractical and expensive to issue.", "165": "Such a bond would have interest and principal repayments in euros, but it would be fairly easy to swap those payments with a bank so that Swedish Match could pay interest in SEK.", "166": "The  effective  interest  rate  after  swapping  was  expected  to  be  similar  to  euro  rates.", "167": "Analysts expected EBITDA to be around SEK 3 billion per year in the next few years.", "168": "16 16 Given this, Dahlgren and  Tilly  thought  that  a  BBB+  rating  would  be  sustainable  under  as  much  as  SEK  4  billion  of additional debt.", "169": "Swedish Match’s board wanted to be conservative, and thought that it was important to be prepared for a worst-case scenario where profitability dropped by as much as half.", "170": "Dahlgren and  Tilly  thus  felt  it  was  prudent  to  consider  a  temporary  drop  in  EBITDA  to  as  low  as  SEK  1.5 billion.", "171": "Swedish  Match shares were  currently trading at  SEK 80 in  Stockholm, slightly  up  over the year to date.", "172": "Decision", "173": "Dahlgren  and  Tilly  believed  that  sensitivity  analyses,  theoretical  valuation  impacts,  signaling considerations,  and  the  availability  of  financing  should  be  key  inputs  into  the  decision.", "174": "Dahlgren elaborated: “Financial risk can ultimately be defined as the risk for a company of either failing to pay the interest on its loans or failing to pay back the entire principal at maturity .", "175": ".", "176": ".", "177": "traditional solvency ratios  such as  equity  over  total  assets  poorly reflect  these  risks.”  Instead,  he  felt  that  a  policy  that targeted  a  rating  such  as  BBB+,  a  reasonable  interest coverage  ratio,  and  suitable  market  leverage would  provide  a  better  target  for  the  firm.", "178": "Under  this  approach,  he  felt  that  substantially  higher leverage could be maintained.", "179": "Taking on more debt and repurchasing shares might involve pushing book equity below zero, but the  new  corporation  law  was  widely  understood  to  allow  this,  and  Dahlgren  felt  that  financial analysts and investors would not find this unsettling.", "180": "Yet Dahlgren understood that the board would raise several concerns about the proposal.", "181": "Would the new leverage affect the firm’s ability to undertake acquisitions?", "182": "Would the firm’s ability to repay its debt be robust even in a cyclical downturn?", "183": "Dahlgren would need to address all of these concerns in the  upcoming meeting.", "184": "As  Dahlgren considered the pros  and  cons of  a new financial  policy, he also pondered the

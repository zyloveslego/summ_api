A New Financial Policy at Swedish Match
In early September 2005, Lars Dahlgren was weighing his options in his Stockholm office. He had recently been appointed CFO of  Swedish Match, a producer of smokeless tobacco, cigars, matches, and lighters. Its most important product was a type of smokeless tobacco called snus a a (see Exhibit 1). At  the  next  meeting  of  Swedish  Match’s  audit  committee,  Dahlgren  was  scheduled  to  present  an annual  review  of  the  financial  plan. Swedish  Match  had  recently  used  bank  loans  to  finance  the acquisition of several cigar firms. However, these debts were being rapidly paid off, and if the firm maintained its traditional policies, its leverage—the ratio of debt to capital—would soon be very low again.
Though the board did not know it yet, Dahlgren was considering a radical proposal: a substantial increase  in  the  firm’s  leverage,  implemented  with  a  Euro-denominated  bond  issue,  and  combined with an aggressive program of share repurchases. This would be a sea change from the firm’s more conservative  financial  practices. After  the  audit  committee  meeting,  Dahlgren  would  propose  the new policy to the full board in its October meeting. b b
Swedish Match and the Match King
Swedish Match had a long and dramatic history, much of it under the leadership of Ivar Kreuger. Born in 1880, Ivar Kreuger—“the Match King”—was one of the wealthiest men in the world when he killed  himself  in  March  1932. Kreuger  had  become  wealthy  by  building  Swedish  Match  into  an international business empire comprised of national monopolies in safety matches. At the time of his death, Swedish Match had a globally dominant position, selling 66% of the world’s matches. 1 1
After  graduating  from  the  Royal  Institute  of  Technology  in  Stockholm  with  a  degree  in mechanical engineering, Kreuger had traveled the world between 1900 and 1907 working in various jobs in Mexico, South Africa, and New York City, where he first learned of steel-reinforced concrete. He  returned  to  Europe  in  1908,  founding  a  building  company  that  applied  the  new  construction

technique. The  firm,  Kreuger  &  Toll,  grew  to  be  worth  SEK  1  million  by  1911. Matches  were  the Kreuger family business, however, and Kreuger soon turned his attention there. In 1903, Sweden had 15 match companies. Six of these merged to form Jönköping och Vulcans Tändsticksfabriks AB (J&V), controlling 80% of the  Swedish match market and threatening the Kreuger family company. Using contacts in the banking industry and his construction profits, Ivar Kreuger was able to raise debt to finance  an  expansion  of  the  family’s  company. He  used  bank  loans  to  merge  Sweden’s  nine remaining  match  companies  in 1913  into AB  Förenade  Svenska  Tändsticksfabriks  (Förenade), with Kreuger in control.
During  World  War  I,  J&V  sold  matches  to  both  sides  of  the  conflict. When  the  Allies  (initially Britain, France, and Russia) suspended J&V import licenses, Förenade, which had sold matches only to  the  Allied  side,  benefitted. In  1916,  J&V  was  forced  to  merge  with  Förenade,  forming  Swedish Match. Ivar Kreuger had gained complete control over the Swedish market for matches.
The monopoly in Sweden proved highly profitable, and Kreuger set out to replicate it elsewhere. As  a  first  step,  in  1917,  Swedish  Match  acquired  majority  holdings  in  Denmark’s  three  match companies, but this tested Kreuger’s ability to borrow in Sweden to the limit. To continue expanding, Kreuger  needed  funding  beyond  the  capacity  of  Swedish  banks. In  1923,  Kreuger  set  up  the International Match  Company (IMCO)  in New  York  City as  a  way to  raise money  from American investors. Raising equity abroad threatened to put Kreuger in violation of Swedish laws that forbade foreign  majority  ownership  of  Swedish  companies. To  avoid  this,  Kreuger  invented  “A”  and  “B” share  classes:  B  shares  gave  investors  only  a  small  percentage  of  the  voting  rights  of  an  A  share, allowing investors to buy stock in Kreuger’s companies without violating Swedish law. Dual share classes  of  this  type  are  still  in  common  use  around  the  world. Kreuger  also  pioneered  the  use  of convertible securities—loans that could be repaid in cash or converted to company stock. 2 2
By  1925,  Swedish  Match  controlled  significant  portions  of  the  match  industries  of  Austria, Belgium, Finland,  Hungary,  Norway,  the Netherlands,  and Switzerland,  and soon  thereafter made acquisitions  in  Japan  and  the  U.S. Creating  national  monopolies  often  required  permission  from national governments. Beginning in 1925, Kreuger began lending money to governments in exchange for monopoly control of their match markets. Ecuador, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Peru,  Poland,  and  Yugoslavia  all  borrowed  money  from  Kreuger,  Swedish  Match,  IMCO,  and  the other companies in Kreuger’s empire. Kreuger raised ever larger sums in New York. Investors were willing  to  supply  funds  for  two  reasons:  the  high  and  stable  dividends  paid  to  investors,  and  the national monopolies that sustained these payouts. Kreuger became world famous.
The stock market crash in 1929 and the worsening business cycle made things harder for Kreuger. Profitability  at  Swedish  Match  faltered  as  the  Great  Depression  deepened. However,  Kreuger’s companies  continued  paying  high  dividends  to  attract  new  investors. As  money  ran  out,  Kreuger paid dividends to his earlier investors with money received from new investors. He covered this up with fraudulent accounting practices and counterfeit documents. This worked for a while, but when Kreuger  tried  to  sell  his  majority  stake  in  the  telecommunications  giant  Ericsson,  an  audit  by  the bankers  at  J.P.  Morgan  revealed  that  some  assets  were  missing. The  bank  blocked  the  deal  in February 1932, initiating one of the largest financial collapses of all time. All sources of debt funding dried up for Kreuger. The Swedish Match share price collapsed. Within a few weeks, Ivar Kreuger shot himself in a Paris hotel, generating worldwide news. 3 3
Swedish Match  survived. In  the wake  of  the  collapse, the  company  divested several  businesses and  focused  on  matches  in  Sweden. Over  the  next  50  years,  Swedish  Match  was  owned  by  a succession of Swedish investors and business groups who operated the match business under various names. By 1992, this match business was combined with the largest Swedish tobacco company, under
A New Financial Policy at Swedish Match  212-017
the Swedish Match name. The firm’s owner spun off Swedish Match in an IPO in 1996. At that time, the business consisted  of matches and  lighters, cigarettes, and  niche tobacco products  (cigars, pipe tobacco, and smokeless tobacco). In 1999, the company divested its remaining cigarette operations to concentrate  on  niche  tobacco  products. The  firm  made  acquisitions  in  cigars,  notably  of  General Cigars, headquartered in Virginia, in 1999. The divestment of cigarettes was a strategic move. In the Swedish market more and more people felt there were advantages to snus, a more socially accepted tobacco  product,  and  Swedish  Match  was  uniquely  positioned  to  take  advantage  of  this  growth. (Exhibit 2 shows summary financial data for the decade ending in 2004.)
Swedish Match in 2005
By 2005, Swedish Match was a worldwide leader in smokeless tobacco products including snuff, snus,  and  chewing  tobacco. The  tobacco  was  sourced  from  carefully  selected  suppliers  and manufactured  in  Sweden. These  business  segments  accounted  for  32%  of  2004  sales  and  72%  of operating  income. 4 4 These  products  were  most  popular in  Scandinavia  and  the  United  States. Snus had been banned in the EU since 1992, but it remained legal in Sweden. Its sale was also allowed in Norway,  which  remained  outside  the  EU. The  EU  debated  the  regulatory  status  of  snus,  and  a general  trend  emerged  of  increased  tobacco  restrictions  as  well  as  concern  about  possible  future regulatory restrictions. However,  some analysts argued that snus faced lower regulatory risks than cigarettes because the health risks were different. 5 5
In  Sweden  and  Norway,  about  one  million  people  used  snus  in  2004,  and  Swedish  Match controlled 96% of the market. 6 6 In Scandinavia, popular snus brands such as General, Göteborgs Rapé, Ettan,  and  Catch  held  a  dominant  market  position. Sweden  was  unique  in  the  EU  with  its  low prevalence  of  cigarette  smoking. Among  Swedish  men,  the  use  of  snus  was  more  common  than smoking cigarettes. 7 7 Growth was also stimulated by the fact that the EU decided to remove the cancer warning  from  the  snus  can  in  2002. With  attractive  margins  and  strong  growth  prospects,  several competitors surfaced during this time on the Swedish market.
The United States was the biggest growth market for smokeless tobacco products, with over 900 million cans of snuff and snus sold in the U.S. in 2004. 8 8 In the United States, Swedish Match offered moist  snuff  brands  Longhorn  and  Timberwolf  and  the  snus  brand  General. The  primary  brands competing  in  the  U.S.  market  included  Grizzly,  Hawken,  and  Kodiak,  all  produced  by  American Snuff  Company,  and  Red  Seal,  Copenhagen,  Rooster,  and  Skoal,  produced  by  U.S.  Smokeless Tobacco  Company. Demand  for  snus  and  moist  snuff  was  growing  in  the  U.S.  in  2004,  as  more people chose smokeless tobacco over cigarettes. 9 9 Red Man, Swedish Match’s chewing tobacco brand, was sold only in the United States and was the market leader, with a 43% market share in 2004, and Swedish Match was hoping for further growth of snus products. 10 10
After  smokeless  tobacco,  Swedish  Match’s  most  important  single  product  was  cigars,  which comprised  24%  of  sales  and  59%  of  operating  income  in  2004. Swedish  Match  was  the  world’s number two cigar manufacturer, and the global leader in the premium segment of the U.S. market. 11 11 Swedish  Match  produced  both  machine-made  and  premium  cigars. Premium  cigars,  which  were made by hand, mostly in Latin America and the Caribbean, accounted for 24% of Swedish Match’s sales  volume,  and  20%  of  operating  income  in  2004. The  market  for  machine-made  cigars  in  the United  States  and  Western  Europe  was  estimated  at  about  13  billion  cigars  per  year,  of  which Swedish  Match  supplied  about  7%. Flavored  cigars  were  considered  the  segment  with  the  largest growth potential. 12 12 Chewing tobacco, a stagnating product category sold mostly in the US, generated 8% of sales and 13% of operating income in 2004.
212-017  A New Financial Policy at Swedish Match
In  addition  to  snus,  snuff,  chewing  tobacco,  and  cigars,  Swedish  Match  also  produced  pipe tobacco,  although  this  was  a  declining  market  (it  shrunk  14%  in  U.S.  sales  volume  in  2004,  for example). Pipe tobacco accounted for about 9% of the company’s operating income. Swedish Match maintained  a  16%  market  share  in  the  U.S.  and  profitability  for  pipe  tobacco  remained  strong. 13 13 Finally, matches accounted for just 11% of the company’s sales in 2004 and 1% of operating income. 14 14 Overall, Scandinavia, the U.S., and the rest of the world each represented approximately one-third of company sales. Costs matched revenues fairly well, so the net currency exposure of Swedish Match was low.
Swedish Match had a conservative policy in all financial matters. At the time of the firm’s IPO in 1996,  management  had  decided  to  target  book  equity  of  at  least  30%  of  assets  (corresponding  to interest-bearing  debt  over  assets  of  20%–40%,  depending  on  the  amount  of  non-interest-bearing liabilities). The firm paid high dividends and made some share repurchases. For a period, leverage had  increased  due  to  acquisitions  in  the  cigar  area. The  company  had  an  international  short-term bond program (the “Global Medium Term Note Program”) and a small Swedish bond program, both started in the late 1990s and by then largely paid off. The firm had a credit rating of A- from rating agency S&P (see Exhibit 5 for data on ratings).
A New Financial Policy
Swedish  Match’s  financial  policy  was  set  by  the  board  of  directors  (see  Exhibit  6  for  a  list  of members). In accordance with Swedish law, two labor representatives were voting members on the board. Swedish Match’s president and CEO, Sven Hindrikes, appointed in 2004, was also a member of the board. Hindrikes had asked Dahlgren to propose a detailed financial policy first to the board’s audit committee and then to the full board in its October 25 meeting. The board would decide on a financial policy, including how to measure leverage and what targets to apply.
Several factors played into Dahlgren’s sense that this was a good time to reconsider the company’s financial policies. First, Sweden had recently instituted a new corporation law that allowed firms to repurchase shares even if it resulted in negative consolidated book equity for the group. Second, a continuation of the current policy would reduce leverage in the next few years. In Dahlgren’s view, Swedish  Match  faced  several  potential  benefits  of  taking  on  more  debt. Leverage  reduced  the corporate income tax bill. As in the United States and many other countries, interest expenses were deductible from corporate income  under Swedish tax law. The corporate income tax rate was 28%, where  it  was  expected  to  remain. c c There  were  other  advantages  to  higher  leverage. Some  viewed excess cash or debt capacity negatively, seeing them as potentially leading to waste and inefficiency.
Further,  the act  of  issuing  new debt  might  be  seen as  a  sign  of  strength. Institutional  investors seemed to agree with a more aggressive policy. In a survey of some large owners earlier that year, several had expressed support for increased repurchases. A Citibank analyst reported, “we expect the company to buy back SEK 9–12 billion in shares by the end of 2007.” 15 15 Dahlgren also felt that the lack of  explicit  financial  targets  created  unnecessary  uncertainty. Finally,  looking  to  international  peers (see Exhibit 7 for selected financials), Dahlgren noticed that many of them maintained high leverage.
In contrast, Dahlgren also ticked off the disadvantages of debt in his head. Net income would be lower, because some of the firm’s cash flows would go to interest payments. Raising new debt might
A New Financial Policy at Swedish Match  212-017
also expose the firm to bond market conditions when needing to refinance. Additionally, taking on more debt would reduce financial flexibility going forward. Dahlgren also had to consider the risk to the  firm’s  business. If  the  smokeless  tobacco  products  faced  more  competition,  the  ability  to  pay interest payments or principal could be in doubt. A forced sale of assets, or even bankruptcy, was a possibility. Credit rating agencies would lower Swedish Match’s credit rating accordingly.
Dahlgren and finance vice president Joakim Tilly discussed a bond issue in the European market, given the modest size of the Swedish bond market. Based on conversations with bankers in London, they felt that bond issues below €300 million, or approximately SEK 3 billion, would be impractical and expensive to issue. Such a bond would have interest and principal repayments in euros, but it would be fairly easy to swap those payments with a bank so that Swedish Match could pay interest in SEK. The  effective  interest  rate  after  swapping  was  expected  to  be  similar  to  euro  rates. Analysts expected EBITDA to be around SEK 3 billion per year in the next few years. 16 16 Given this, Dahlgren and  Tilly  thought  that  a  BBB+  rating  would  be  sustainable  under  as  much  as  SEK  4  billion  of additional debt. Swedish Match’s board wanted to be conservative, and thought that it was important to be prepared for a worst-case scenario where profitability dropped by as much as half. Dahlgren and  Tilly  thus  felt  it  was  prudent  to  consider  a  temporary  drop  in  EBITDA  to  as  low  as  SEK  1.5 billion. Swedish  Match shares were  currently trading at  SEK 80 in  Stockholm, slightly  up  over the year to date.
Decision
Dahlgren  and  Tilly  believed  that  sensitivity  analyses,  theoretical  valuation  impacts,  signaling considerations,  and  the  availability  of  financing  should  be  key  inputs  into  the  decision. Dahlgren elaborated: “Financial risk can ultimately be defined as the risk for a company of either failing to pay the interest on its loans or failing to pay back the entire principal at maturity . . . traditional solvency ratios  such as  equity  over  total  assets  poorly reflect  these  risks.”  Instead,  he  felt  that  a  policy  that targeted  a  rating  such  as  BBB+,  a  reasonable  interest coverage  ratio,  and  suitable  market  leverage would  provide  a  better  target  for  the  firm. Under  this  approach,  he  felt  that  substantially  higher leverage could be maintained.
Taking on more debt and repurchasing shares might involve pushing book equity below zero, but the  new  corporation  law  was  widely  understood  to  allow  this,  and  Dahlgren  felt  that  financial analysts and investors would not find this unsettling.
Yet Dahlgren understood that the board would raise several concerns about the proposal. Would the new leverage affect the firm’s ability to undertake acquisitions? Would the firm’s ability to repay its debt be robust even in a cyclical downturn? Dahlgren would need to address all of these concerns in the  upcoming meeting. As  Dahlgren considered the pros  and  cons of  a new financial  policy, he also pondered the appropriate amount and structure for a bond issue.

€2 billion impact to EBIT…Additional 6 to 7 month delay…Penalty payments to customers.

Melissa Hayes had taken over management of Justice Investments’ Value Europe Fund (JIVE) more than five months ago, time enough for her to have developed detailed knowledge about each of its investments and reaffirm the value-based strategy that had kept it in the top quartile of performance against its peers for the last one-, three-, and five-year periods. Long enough, too, for her to realize the gravity of the news she’d just received concerning another delay in the delivery of Airbus SAS’s new A380 commercial aircraft.

JIVE held a substantial stake in the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS), which was the majority owner of Airbus. In fact, Airbus contributed approximately 80% of EADS’s operating profit, and was the primary driver of its valuation. Whether the further delay in the delivery of the A380 would subject EADS to a selloff in the market wasn’t the question; the question was how bad the selloff would be.

The history of state influence on Airbus, and a disappointing first delay in the delivery of the critical A380 announced in 2005, had given Hayes some initial reservations about the fund’s position in EADS. But there were also signs—steady improvements in the commercial aircraft market, relative pricing stability, and stronger shareholder accountability from EADS—that EADS could be a solid investment for a value-based fund.

With Airbus on the verge of proving itself the leader in the large commercial aircraft manufacturing space, the timing of the second delay could not have been more inopportune. In a market already unsettled by news in April that BAE Systems was considering selling its 20% stake in

Airbus EADS,

How could this delay have occurred, particularly after management’s reassurances in the wake of the 2005 delay? As recently as the Q1 2006 earnings call on May 16, 2006, Airbus had expressed confidence in the A380 readiness program. investment file on EADS in the hope of finding something that would shed light on this latest development. She needed a sound perspective on whether or not to change the level of EADS holdings in the JIVE portfolio.

Into an already vibrant commercial aircraft industry World War II injected an additional mobilization of investment and innovation. The jet engine, streamlined manufacturing processes, and improved designs, among other technological advances, revolutionized commercial air transportation in the late 1950s. As planes grew larger and more advanced, a handful of western manufacturers with wartime manufacturing capacity and engineering know-how emerged with the resources and product line needed to survive in what was becoming an increasingly competitive landscape.

As scale became the ultimate competitive advantage, the number of manufacturers of large commercial aircraft declined over the course of two decades to what had essentially become the duopoly of Airbus and Boeing. Lockheed Corporation, which exited the commercial aircraft business in the mid-1980s following disappointing sales of its L-1011, eventually merged with Martin Marietta to form one of the world’s largest defense contractors, MD-11 and DC-10) merged with Boeing in 1997. and Boeing overcame significant challenges to continue to add customers and new models to replace the MD-11s, DC-10s, and L-1011s being taken out of service by the larger airlines.

Long regarded as the powerhouse in the large commercial aircraft market, Boeing acknowledged Airbus to be its most daunting competitor. The possibility of other companies seriously challenging the Boeing-Airbus duopoly was decades away at least. One potential contender taking shape in the east was United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), which had its genesis in February 2006 in the consolidation of Tupolev (manufacturer of the Tu-154), Ilyushin (manufacturer of the Il-62, Il-86 and Il-96), Sukhoi (manufacturer of the Superjet 100), and other state-owned aircraft construction companies by a Russian government attempting to revitalize and modernize the country’s declining civilian aircraft manufacturing industry. state funding to nurture a critical industry back to competitiveness, Russia was taking a page from the playbook of obviously successful Airbus. The dominant regional commercial aircraft manufacturers, Embraer (manufacturer of the ERJ 135, ERJ 140, ERJ 145, E-170/175, and E-190/195)

and that top EADS shareholders Lagardère and DaimlerChrysler would cut their stakes in the advantage could easily shift back to long-time competitor Boeing. and Bombardier (manufacturer of the CRJ100, CRJ200, CRJ700 and CRJ900), might also one day pose a threat, though for the present both seemed content to solidify their positions in the market for regional commercial aircraft with approximately 100 seats.

What did seem clear was that the market for commercial aircraft would continue to grow. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) reported that over 2 billion passengers and 38 million tons of freight carried by the world’s airlines in 2005 was up from 1,888 million passengers and 37 million tons of freight in 2004, and predicted that passenger traffic would grow by 6% in 2006, 5.8% in 2007, and 5.6% in 2008, and by more than 5% over the coming decade. With options for meeting this surging demand limited for many airports due to expansion constraints, and with the busiest airports already congested, increasing aircraft capacity seemed a viable way to meet projected growth.

Although they competed along the spectrum of aircraft sizes and models, Boeing and Airbus did not seem to share the same assessments of how the market would evolve. Betting that carriers preferred smaller, more efficient aircraft suited to point-to-point operations, Boeing was gambling on its new, mid-sized 787, which seated 210–310 depending on model variation and configuration. The A380, on the other hand, reflected Airbus’s belief that airlines wanted higher capacity planes to accommodate expanding passenger traffic at congested hubs with limited landing and takeoff slots. The A380 could move more passengers through these hubs at lower cost per seat, enabling the airlines to serve high capacity routes more economically.

Airbus’ formation was negotiated in the mid-1960s by ministers from France, Germany, and the United Kingdom seeking to counter U.S. domination of the large passenger aircraft industry. The European aircraft market was populated by too many small manufacturers, none with sufficient scale to challenge the Americans. European firms, unless they cooperated, risked being marginalized by their larger American counterparts.

Earlier efforts by the Europeans to advance their aeronautical industry through collaboration had yielded mixed results. The Concorde, for example, an Anglo-French supersonic passenger airliner, had been a technical marvel but a financial failure due to high costs and a small target market.

Sufficient momentum was generated to push the Airbus initiative past the considerable debate on the role each country would play in any joint manufacturing and design effort, which companies would be involved, where new manufacturing facilities would be located, and how risks would be shared. The first aircraft production program of the nascent consortium, dubbed the A300, went a long way towards establishing Airbus’s long-term potential. According to a memorandum of understanding drafted between the governments in 1967, France and the United Kingdom were each to have 37.5% of the work share, Germany 25%, and Rolls-Royce responsibility for manufacturing the engines for the A300. When lukewarm market response put government funding in jeopardy, the size of the A300 was reduced to make it more attractive, which significantly reduced the cost of the program by eliminating the need for Rolls-Royce to design a larger engine. The decision to not use the Rolls-Royce engine and doubts about the undertaking’s financial viability contributed to the United Kingdom pulling out of the Airbus program in 1969.

The consortium went forward, however, and Airbus Industrie came into being in December 1970. The British government’s withdrawal notwithstanding, British manufacturing company Hawker Siddeley Aviation decided to remain engaged as a preferred sub-contractor. British Aerospace (a precursor to BAE Systems) absorbed Hawker Siddeley in 1977, and acquired a 20% share of Airbus in early 1979. The ownership of the remaining 80% was shared by Deutsche Airbus of Germany (37.9% ownership), Aerospatiale of France (37.9% ownership), and Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA (CASA) of Spain (4.2% ownership). Deutsche Airbus was later succeeded by DaimlerChrysler Aerospace AG (DASA) of Germany, and Aerospatiale by Aérospatiale-Matra of France.

Although the A300 enjoyed success in the market, by the late 1990s it had become apparent within Airbus that continued success would depend on the organization being more fully integrated and streamlined. A structure that permitted the partners to operate as both shareholders and suppliers created an adverse incentive to inflate transfer costs to maximize individual profits. The partners were not required to open their books, share intellectual property, or engage in activities that maximized the value of the overall enterprise. In July 2000, following considerable negotiation, three of the four Airbus partners, DASA, Aérospatiale-Matra, and CASA, merged to form the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company (EADS), and Airbus Industrie was transformed from a consortium into a formal joint stock company, Airbus SAS. EADS was to own 80% of the new Airbus and control five of the seven Airbus board seats, the fourth partner, BAE Systems, to own 20% and control the remaining two board seats.

EADS, which had a dual French-German management structure with two CEOs and two board chairmen and a board of directors composed almost entirely of insiders or appointees of large corporate shareholders, exerted a great deal of influence over operational decisions at Airbus. Without its approval, Airbus leadership could not undertake material changes in operations or strategy. The shared management structure, lack of independent board members, and limited autonomy were perceived to be a source of inefficiency and confusion.

Although EADS established a range of business divisions, Airbus remained the largest by far. (Table A summarizes the 2005 financial performance of each division.)

Table A Summary of Financial Performance of EADS Divisions in 2005

Airbus rolled out a wide range of commercial aircraft subsequent to the A300. A comprehensive product line that encompassed aircraft ranging from 107 to more than 550 seats, including the singleaisle A320 (A318/A319/A320/A321), wide-body long-range A330/A340, and ultra long-range, double-decker A380, families was to be complemented by an extra wide body aircraft in the early design stages dubbed the A350. Aircraft offered for sale by Airbus are listed in Exhibit 1. When, upon the industrial launch of the A350 program in October 2005, the design was criticized as a half-hearted response to Boeing’s successful 787 , Airbus took under advisement an overhaul of the design that would respond to customer concerns. But any material redesign of the A350 would likely delay the aircraft’s launch as well as increase development costs.

The use of common cockpit systems and fly-by-wire across its product line differentiated Airbus from Boeing. Common cockpit systems assured maximum commonality of cockpit configuration and operating procedures across Airbus models; fly-by-wire accommodated similar handling across models. By making it easier to cross-train pilots on different Airbus aircraft, these features reduced training costs and facilitated cross-crew qualification and mixed-fleet flying by affording greater flexibility in matching aircraft with available pilots.

Over time, Airbus had succeeded in expanding its customer base from large European airlines to a range of airlines worldwide. (A selection of Airbus’s largest customers is listed in Exhibit 2.)

Airbus had begun to evaluate the market for a large aircraft response to the Boeing 747 series as early as 1991, and established in May 1996 a Large Aircraft Division to develop plans for the A3XX, a double-decker aircraft Airbus projected would carry more than 550 passengers. The program was rechristened the A380 program upon its official launch in 2000. The major milestones in the launch of the A380 are summarized in Table B.

With approximately 633 square meters of cabin area and accommodation for more than 550 passengers, which compares to approximately 527 square meters and more than 410 passengers for the Boeing 747-400, the A380 was the largest commercial aircraft ever built. $285 million was raised to $295 million in June 2005, with another increase expected in 2006. Airbus projected sales of more than 700 A380s during the aircraft’s estimated 30- to 40-year lifespan

Airbus’s forecast of a market for approximately 1,200 very large passenger and 400 very large freight aircraft by 2025 represented a market value of approximately $416 billion. conservative estimate was for approximately 530 such aircraft by 2025.

In 2006, Airbus had firm orders for 159 A380s, 132 for the passenger version and 27 for the freight version (order details are provided in Exhibit 3). November 2005 launch of the 747-8 Intercontinental program (747-8) to serve the 400- to 500-seat market between the 550+ seat Airbus A380 and 365-seat Boeing 777-300 Extended Range aircraft. Boeing hoped that the competition introduced by the 747-8, scheduled to enter service in 2010, with 467 seats in a standard 3-class configuration, would have the potential to slow sales of the A380.

The market for commercial aircraft larger than the Boeing 747-400 was driven by the growth of the airline market generally, flight congestion at major airports, increased cost pressure on airlines, and demand for more environmentally-friendly aircraft. Many of these factors presupposed improved technology, superior design, new manufacturing processes, and better supplier collaboration. To minimize weight and reduce fuel costs, for example, the A380 incorporated a range of advanced materials such as carbon fiber reinforced plastics and a new aluminum and fiberglass laminate called

Glare. The design and implementation of such advanced materials necessitated close coordination with a wider range of suppliers. It also meant that some elements had to be outsourced to suppliers that possessed deep expertise in particular areas and required creative thinking on the part of such suppliers about how the expertise of secondary suppliers might be exploited to meet specifications and requirements. All of which would increase the complexity of the supply chain.

The A380 program was instrumental in driving fundamental changes at Airbus, forcing it to reevaluate its consortium structure, manufacturing processes, and corporate governance. It contributed directly to the largest transformation in the company’s 30+ year history - the reorganization of the consortium into an integrated company and the formation of EADS in 2000. Manufacturing and design of the A380 was spread across 85 countries, dozens of Airbus facilities, and hundreds of suppliers. A single chief engineer was made responsible for the entire program across the four operating divisions that were formerly independently managed by France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Spain, new manufacturing processes and organizations were introduced, and the program was organized around the physical deliverables needed to build the aircraft rather than national borders, and the work distributed among integrated development teams.

The nine aircraft component management teams (ACMTs) responsible for the development of the major elements of the 380 were: 1) Forward fuselage, 2) Aft fuselage, 3) Wing, 4) Empennage, 5) Propulsion, 6) Landing gear and associated systems, 7) Cabin and cabin systems, 8) Aircraft systems, and 9) Final assembly.

To ensure smooth coordination and communication with sub-elements within each of the nine major elements, component management integration teams (CMITs) collaborated with the ACMTs and approximately 100 component design build teams (CDBTs) responsible for sub-elements of the aircraft. Airbus concurrent engineering (ACE) methods and processes facilitated data sharing online and integration of all tasks linked to product design, manufacturing, and support. Airbus used ACE to manage the hundreds of suppliers that provided critical components for nearly every subassembly and assembly in the A380. (A sample of these suppliers is provided in Exhibit 4.)

The first A380 development center opened in 2001 in Hamburg, Germany. The German division of Airbus, which included facilities in Bremen, Stade, Hamburg, Dresden, Finkenwerder, Laupheim, Nordenham, and Varel, manufactured and assembled the forward and aft fuselage components, carbon fiber reinforced plastic vertical tail plane, wing trailing edge flaps, and cabin furnishing, and was responsible for final assembly of the fuselage subassemblies, cabin painting, and delivery to customers in Europe and the Middle East. The U.K. division of Airbus, which included facilities in Broughton and Filton, manufactured the wings, wing-box, aluminum alloy wing skins, and wing ribs. The Spanish division, which included facilities in Illescas, Puerto Real, and Getafe, manufactured the composite horizontal tail-plane, tail-plane boxes, aft fuselage, main gear doors, rudder, dorsal fin, and belly fairing. The French division, which included facilities in Meaulte, Nantes, St Nazaire, and Toulouse, manufactured the fuselage shells, nose, center fuselage, and main wing box, and was responsible for final assembly of the A380 and delivery to customers in the Americas and Asia Pacific.

Altogether, not counting supplier facilities, 16 Airbus sites scattered across Europe were involved in the construction of the major components of the A380. Each site produced a complete section of the aircraft, which was transported to the final assembly lines in Toulouse by air, land, and sea, the size of the subassemblies presenting a major challenge. Indeed, many of the manufacturing facilities were purpose-built to accommodate the massive size of the A380 and its component pieces—the final assembly site in Toulouse, for example, having a ground surface of 500 meters by 250 meters.

The logistics of transporting components from one site to another were as impressive as the manufacturing facilities. Barges and trucks also often had to be purpose-built to move the structural elements, such as the center fuselage and wing assembly which weighed approximately 100 tons. The aft fuselage sections were flown on the largest extant transport plane, the A300 Beluga, from Getafe to Finkenwerder for attachment to the rear fuselage. After assembly and equipment installation in Finkenwerder, the forward and rear fuselage sections were taken to Bordeaux by ship, with stops en route at a port near the Broughton plant to pick up the wings and at St. Nazaire to drop off a forward fuselage to be attached to a nose section and pick up a completed forward fuselage and nose assembly. The horizontal tail plane was transported by road from Puerto Real to the Spanish port of Cadiz, and loaded onto a ship for delivery to Bordeaux. Wing assemblies were shipped by river barge from Broughton to the sea and loaded onto to a ship bound for Bordeaux. From Bordeaux, the subassemblies were transported by specially-made river barges to Langon, and from Langon to Toulouse on purpose-built trucks, the latter journey accomplished at night over a span of three days and necessitating construction of four parking areas and several city bypasses. The rudder was trucked from Puerto Real to Stade for attachment to the fin, and the fin and vertical tail-plane barged to Finkenwerder and flown to Toulouse.

Finish work on the vertical tail-plane, horizontal tail-plane, fuselage, and wings was performed in Toulouse, and the fuselage, wings, empennage, gear, and pylons assembled at a single station there. The engines were subsequently installed on the airframe and tested. After completing successful production test flights, aircraft were flown to Finkenwerder for final furnishing and painting.

The need for collaboration between suppliers and organizations not regularly associated with those suppliers put additional pressures on the supply chain. Airbus and its suppliers had to not only manage close and continuous interactions with more than 20 airlines and 60 airports, but also, to ensure compatibility among equipment, operational practices, and functional specifications, develop deep working relationships with other entities that would be affected by the A380 including the Federal Aviation Administration, European Aviation Safety Agency, ground handlers, ground equipment manufacturers, International Air Transport Association, ICAO, and the Airport Council International and International Organization for Standardization.

Owing to the A380’s anticipated substantial impact on airport facilities, the most time consuming of the coordination efforts were perhaps those that involved airports and airport services. Airports, according to the ICAO, would need to expand their facilities and make heavy investments in infrastructure to safely accommodate the A380. The approximately $8 billion in investment anticipated by 2015 to prepare airport facilities for the A380 included widening runways, taxiways, and shoulders, reinforcing pavement, installing updated signals and lights, modifying blast pads and bridges, acquiring necessary tractors, loaders, and fire and safety tools, constructing larger gates, and expanding passenger and baggage handling facilities and systems. Among the more than 60 airports worldwide preparing to accommodate the A380 were London Heathrow, Singapore Changi International, Tokyo Narita International, Paris Charles de Gaulle, Frankfurt International, and New York John F Kennedy International. Airbus predicted that 23 airports would be ready to handle the A380 by the end of 2006. It projected 79 airports to be ready by 2010, among which 18 to 22 airports for the Asia Pacific region, 12 to 14 airports for North America, six to seven airports for the Middle East and Africa, and four to five for Europe.

The complexity of the A380 supply chain afforded ample opportunities for challenges that could disrupt the schedule performance. On April 27, 2005, the day of the first test flight, Airbus announced delivery of the first A380s to Singapore Airlines in the second half of 2006 instead of the original commitment of March 2006. Airbus did not immediately recognize the domino effect of the delays, or, if it did, believed that it could be contained. As late as June 2006, some customers scheduled to take delivery of A380s beyond Q1 of 2007 had not been notified of any change in delivery date. According to the International Herald Tribune of June 2, 2005, Malaysian Airlines had not been informed of any delays, spokesperson Jackie Christie being quoted as saying: “It’s still status quo. Until advised otherwise, we’ll still take it as the date stated” (being April 2007). German airline Lufthansa’s CEO Wolfgang Mayrhuber similarly indicated that Lufthansa anticipated taking delivery of its 15 A380s at the end of 2007.

Airbus and EADS appeared to struggle with how to appropriately represent the delay, as evidenced by the following exchange during the EADS Q1 2005 earnings call on May 9, 2005. Winfried Becker, Oppenheim Research analyst, asked the following question:

Yes, good morning, gentlemen. Winfried Becker from Oppenheim. Concerning . . . the A380 program, if I have got it right, you have postponed some months the first delivery to Singapore Airlines next year. Could you be a bit more precise on that, and more important, how would that affect maybe your overall delivery plans to all the other airlines in 2006, 2007 and so on? Thank you.

Hans Peter Ring, EADS CFO, replied:

Thanks Winfried, [indiscernible] in Frankfurt. A380 and Singapore, I mean, obviously we are in close contact with the airlines supposed to get aircraft next year, and the speculation about the delay to the second half, I mean, we already for some time were planning the delivery in the second half, probably very early in the second half, but it was the second half anyway. So that did not actually change. I mean, we were probably a few weeks later with the first flight and we will have to wait, I think, until the first few months of certification and testing activity to finally commit how many aircraft we will deliver next year, and you will remember that we announced originally that it would be around 10. It might be a bit below 10, but basically, if you have seen the comments of other airlines like Emirates, they are also supposed to get an aircraft next year. They are not really worried about that because they also take and need some time for the certification of their interiors. So this is, to a certain extent, also depending upon our customers, but certainly the real question will be the maturity of the production ramp-up and first, before that, the final certification of the aircraft, and as of today, it’s probably too early to give new guidance on that.

As delays in production that pushed back early deliveries began to impact the timing of later deliveries, Airbus started notifying all customers that the delivery schedule for the A380 program would slip, eventually updating its customer delivery schedule to reflect the full impact of the anticipated delay (see Table C).

Table C Effect of First Delay on Annual A380 Customer Deliveries

According to CNN, several A380 customers expressed disappointment upon learning of the delay. Emirates Airlines’ CEO characterized the delay as a “serious issue,” and several others, including Qantas and Singapore Airlines, indicated that they would seek compensation for the delivery setback. but indicated that these could not be disclosed as negotiations with those customers were ongoing.

The first delay was attributed primarily to difficulties with the aircraft wiring, which consisted of nearly 100,000 wires bundled into 530 kilometers of cables held in place by 40,000 connectors. complexity of the wiring problems was compounded by a switch from copper to aluminum wiring, incompatibility between two versions of the same design software being used by Airbus engineers, and the variety of configuration options Airbus offered its customers.

The switch from copper to aluminum wiring was likely made to reduce weight, but different properties of the latter included a larger bend radius that made it more difficult to maneuver around corners within an aircraft and could entail rerouting of some harnesses. These changes may not have been adequately captured in the integrated shared master design model because of compatibility issues caused by the A380 teams in Spain and Germany using an earlier version of design software than the teams in the United Kingdom and France. The wiring issues were compounded by the unprecedented degree of flexibility Airbus had offered its customers with respect to the configuration of the aircraft. Airlines that had ordered the A380 were eager to implement new cabin layout ideas in order to make a splash in the market. Virgin Atlantic, for example, had proposed a casino area and space for exercising, Qantas special lounge areas and facilities for business meetings and

Airbus conceded that the delay would likely incur some penalty payments to customers, presentations. The customization associated with the configurability options increased the complexity of the cabin wiring.

Although EADS did not minimize the risks associated with the launch of the A380, the company did indicate that the problems were contained and that further slippages were not expected. News out of Airbus regarding the progress of the A380 became consistently positive after mid-June 2005 (see Table D).

Table D Airbus Press Releases on the A380 between June 15, 2005 and June 1, 2006

Although the communication from the executive team at EADS remained generally positive, Airbus’s A380 program problems seemed to persist. Andrea Jao, Lehman Brothers analyst, asked during the Q1 2006 earnings call on May 16, 2006, “[C]an you just comment again on the A380? The certification process and whether there are any reviews on the workload for 2007?” Hans Peter Ring, EADS COO for Finance, replied:

The program is progressing; you have seen some of the milestones which were communicated publicly. We do have [so] in the ramp-up, a lot of outstanding work of the sections which are arriving in Toulouse. The next significant and important step in the rampup process is the cabin specification, which is currently underway; we just started with the virtual cabin test on ground, which worked satisfactorily. So it was more or less okay, or as expected.

But we will have to wait for the [route] proofing and for the long-range flights with the aircraft, which will be done in July and probably August, and depending on the final outcome of that we will finally be able to assess the impact we might have on the ramp-up process. So this is something which is underway and, as I said in the speech, Airbus is obviously heavily focusing on this issue currently. coming into the EBIT line from that, and even for next year, even in case we would not meet the final planned delivery rate of around 20, even then there wouldn’t be a material impact on EBIT next year because of the learning curve effect.

The problems, however, eventually surfaced, and after the close of trading on 13 June 2006, Airbus announced the second delay to the A380 program, which did have an impact on EBIT in 2007 of €500 million, and an equivalent projected impact each year from 2008 through 2010. also significantly shift delivery dates. (Table E summarizes the projected impact on customer deliveries; a copy of the press release announcing the delay is reproduced as Exhibit 5.)

Table E Effect of First and Second Delay on Annual A380 Customer Deliveries

Airbus maintained that the second delay was “traceable to bottlenecks formed in the definition, manufacturing, and installation of electrical systems and resulting harnesses,” in other words, reminiscent of the problem to which the first delay announced more than a year earlier had been attributed. how that community, or the overall market for that matter, would react to the latest announced delay in the A380 program was unclear. The closing share price of EADS prior to the delay announced on June 13, 2006 was €25.42. following EADS stock as of 12 June 2006.)

But in terms of EBIT impact, we would not expect that for this year there is anything

Whereas the analyst community had been generally positive about EADS’s prospects,

Table F Sample of Analyst Target Prices and Ratings (if provided) on EADS as of June 12, 2006

Evaluating the real financial impact of the second delay would be a challenge. There were a variety of costs that could prove to be material, including customer penalty payments, incremental labor expenses, incremental material expenses, inventory carrying costs, and redesign costs. There were also a number of potential revenue implications, including the possibility of canceled orders, a lower win rate on future sales opportunities, and delays in recognizing revenue from current sales. To further complicate matters, there was the risk that the A380 program would experience further delivery difficulties.

Questions swirled in Hayes’ mind. Was the wire cabling problem now truly contained by Airbus, or were there aspects of the problem management still did not fully understand? Had a cushion been built into the new A380 delivery schedule in case other problems arose? Were there other dependencies on the critical path for the program that could jeopardize delivery dates? How would customers respond to this unexpected second delay? What effect would this delay have on the pipeline of potential sales opportunities?

EADS’s management team had scheduled an analyst and investor call for June 14, 2006 at 10:00 a.m., Paris time, and Hayes planned to join it. As she contemplated possible reactions of other investors and analysts on the call and how the market would respond when trading resumed on June 14, Hayes received an e-mail from a colleague marked “Urgent—Deutsche Bank Bulletin on EADS.” She opened the attachment and read the document titled “A380 woes; downgrading recommendation to Hold” (the Deutsche Bank bulletin is reproduced as Exhibit 6). Hayes understood that she needed a well-developed perspective tonight on the JIVE investment in EADS as that perspective would certainly be challenged when the markets opened tomorrow. It looked as if it would be an interesting day.

Exhibit 5 Copy of Airbus Press Release Dated June 13, 2006

Airbus maintains target date for A380 certification and first delivery by year end, but announces shift in the production programme

13 June 2006

Airbus has informed its customers today that a review of the A380 programme has shown that the delivery schedule will undergo a shift of six to seven months due to production ramp-up issues. In parallel, Airbus confirmed to its customers the satisfactory progress of the flight test campaign, which is expected to lead to certification and delivery of the first aircraft by the end of the year. The shift in the production ramp-up is likely to limit aircraft delivery to nine in 2007.

The new delays are caused by industrial issues only. They are mainly traceable to bottlenecks formed in the definition, manufacturing and installation of electrical systems and resulting harnesses.

As testing and development advances, as well as customisation specifications from airlines are integrated, modifications of electrical systems and reworks have been necessary at section level, progressively disturbing the final assembly flow. A new organisation for the equipment of sections and a revised pacing of transfer to the final assembly line have been put in place, to absorb past inventory build-up and to deal with further mitigating factors. As a result, there are currently 15 aircraft already assembled, including the static and fatigue test frames, while production of sections for aircraft serial number 36 has started.

A recent programme review has led Airbus to the conclusion that 2007 deliveries will likely be limited to nine, and that a shortfall of five to nine aircraft deliveries in 2008 and around five aircraft in 2009 could be expected, compared to initial delivery planning. The review also concluded that further actions are required to secure a ramp-up recovery in 2008 and 2009.

Today, Airbus President and CEO Gustav Humbert has ordered the immediate setting up and implementation of such a recovery action plan. Airbus also announced to regularly update airlines and all stakeholders on the progress of the recovery action plan.

Airbus is fully aware of the burden this industrial issue represents for the airlines who are anxious to begin operating the A380. Airbus is working with its customers to facilitate their operations, while ensuring a successful entry into service.

Airbus continues to be very satisfied by the performance of the A380. The aircraft handles extremely well and airline pilots who have already flown the aircraft, report enthusiastically about it. Overall, the aircraft have performed more than 1,400 flight hours in over 430 flights and 950 take-offs. Results are as predicted. All the tests performed, including at airports, indicate that the A380 will meet or exceed the expectations. Also first results of the cabin tests are encouraging. Since the first flight of the first A380 in Toulouse on 27 April 2005, four more aircraft have taken to the air. The first two are heavily involved in the flight test campaign, two more are used for cabin testing and the fifth one is currently undergoing customisation and cabin furnishing in Hamburg to be ready for first aircraft delivery at the end of 2006.

A Happy Anniversary Lunch, and Then.

I won’t soon forget my fourth wedding anniversary. Four years earlier, a woman had entered my life and changed it. On that fourth anniversary day, another woman entered my life—and my courtroom—and changed my perceptions a bit.

That day for me blended the ingredients of successful marriage with something that is usually unrelated—contempt of court. Much has been written of the first; the second tends to be briefly noted in the newspaper and then consigned to the law books.

Judges’ contempt powers are awesome. When these posers much be used, the judicial officer becomes not only judge, jury and executioner, but also witness because, in most instances, the courtroom is where the contemptuous act occurs. It is the judge who, based on his standards of seemly conduct, determines what a contemptuous act is, and it is the judge who, based on the facts, decides if a contemptuous act has been committed. If he so rules, it is the judge who punishes by imposing sentence.

Because he has such powers, a judge must be slow to anger and quick to forgive; otherwise he may risk abusing these powers.

But to return to the events of my fourth anniversary:

On this special day I planned to lunch at home with my wife. But before I could leave the courthouse I had to deal with three cases—all scheduled to begin at 11:30. I hoped to get one set up for trial in the afternoon, then postpone the others. It was 11:45, however, before all three defendants were in the courtroom and I was studying the complaints against them: One was charged with assault, another with driving under the influence, and the third with theft.

I had to decide which to hear first, and that day my choice was not so much conscious as random. I simply picked up one of the three pink complaint slips and called the name typed on it. Up stepped a woman in her 40s, a lawyer at her side.

“You, ma’am” I told the woman, “are charged with violating Section 23102a of the Vehicle Code—operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor and while under the combined influence of intoxicating liquor and a drug. The offense is alleged to have occurred on or about. …”

“Drugs?” she shrieked. “What are you trying to pull?”

“ma’am, I am only telling you what the complaint sets out as the charge; I don’t know anything at all about the facts of the case.”

“What kind of kangaroo court is this?” she screamed.

“Please stop talking,” I said. “Not one more word. I expect each male who comes to the courtroom to act like a gentleman and each female to act like a lady. Leave now. You are ordered to come back at 1:30 pm. I will expect you to act like a lady at that time or you will face problems totally unrelated to the charge which brought you to court.”

Defendants and witnesses in the remaining cases bristled. I bristled. The courtroom personnel bristled. The other cases, how ever, however, went routinely. It was a few minutes past noon when I gaveled the session to a close.

On the 15-minute drive home, I was preoccupied with pleasant reveries about my wedding day four years earlier and the lunch I would soon have with my wife. The baby would already have been fed, so there would be just my wife and me to share memories.

Our time together, however, was much too brief. At 1 pm, it was time to leave, for a pressing court calendar awaited me. Worse yet, I would have to deal with the bitter-tongued woman of my morning session whose case I’d held over. Driving back to the courthouse, I ran through a scenario in my head: I’ll start by explaining that I, as a judge, had nothing to do with filing the original charge against her—its content (which had prompted her outburst) is strictly the prosecutor’s responsibility.

Bac in court, the spectators settled in their seats as I asked the woman to step forward. For 10 minutes I drove home my point, taking care to be fair and thorough. The woman smiled and nodded, so I thought things were going smoothly.

Then I asked: “Do you understand the nature of the charges lodged against you?”

“When do I genuflect?” she said sarcastically.

My response was immediate. For making that statement you are held in contempt of court. The sentence is three days in jail. Take her away.”

I stepped down quickly from the bench. It was now 1:45 pm and there was no time to lose. Preparation of a contempt commitment, fully describing what had transpired, was needed to explain why the woman should be jailed. Should my contempt order be tested in higher court, my action would stand or fall on its content.

When my secretary arrived, I rushed through a first draft. Time was of the essence: Until that paper was prepared in its final form and signed by me, all female prisoners in the court complex faced delays in being transported to the County Jail.

After dictating the draft, I realized I had done nothing about the charges that had brought the woman into my court. All I had done was react with anger on hearing the word “genuflect.” Now it was too late—she was gone. There was no way to rectify my error, and after the incident I knew I shouldn’t try. I returned her case to the calendar court for reassignment to another judge.

By 4 pm I had signed the final contempt order in accordance with the California Code of  Civil Procedure. Then, after presiding at another trial, I headed home with some relief.

At the wheel, I reflected on the day’s meaning. It was not the first time in six years as a judge that I had encountered erratic behavior, nor will it be the last. Almost always I give the offenders a chance to think things over, to retract their statements or retreat from their positions. Almost always they do.

Why was today different? One lesson it taught was that judges, just like defendants, are individuals with complex hopes, aspirations, and expectations. Judges are human. They live in communities. They had wedding anniversaries. They react to to events both within and without the courtroom.

On occasion, people overreact—on both sides of the bench. On occasion these facts of life are forgotten by judges and non-judges alike. Surely, from time to time, it is a good thing for judges to be reminded of their frailties, the better to wield their enormous power over those in trouble.

My reflective mood was broken when, on arriving home, I entered the kitchen to my wife’s greeting. “hi, deer,” she said. “Happy anniversary—again. Did you have a good afternoon?”
